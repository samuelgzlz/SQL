##FORTUNE 500 analytics

##Small project for the Break Into Tech course.
##This includes data analysis for various companies and the SQL code had to include the following at least once:

##Group the data in a new way using a CASE statement.
##Use a HAVING clause to determine something interesting about the data per category.
##Use logical operators like AND or OR to filter the data in an interesting way.
##Use an aggregate function like AVG, SUM, COUNT, MAX, and/or MIN to return summary statistics about the data.
