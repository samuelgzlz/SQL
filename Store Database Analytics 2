## In this project I'm using SQL to analyze a store database and get insights about inventory, prices, and customer preferred items.

CREATE TABLE superstore (
    item_id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY,
    item_name TEXT,
    category TEXT,
    price DECIMAL(10, 2),
    stock_quantity INTEGER,
    average_rating DECIMAL(3, 2)
);

INSERT INTO superstore (item_id, item_name, category, price, stock_quantity, average_rating)
VALUES
    (1, 'Stainless Steel Cookware Set', 'Kitchen Supplies', 89.99, 50, 4.6),
    (2, 'Memory Foam Mattress', 'Furnishings', 499.99, 30, 4.8),
    (3, 'Smart LED TV', 'Electronics', 549.00, 20, 4.5),
    (4, 'Robot Vacuum Cleaner', 'Appliances', 199.50, 40, 4.3),
    (5, 'Wireless Bluetooth Speaker', 'Electronics', 39.99, 60, 4.2),
    (6, 'Non-Stick Baking Set', 'Kitchen Supplies', 29.95, 80, 4.4),
    (7, 'Cotton Bedding Set', 'Furnishings', 89.00, 25, 4.7),
    (8, 'Smart Home Security Camera', 'Electronics', 79.95, 15, 4.1),
    (9, 'Air Purifier', 'Appliances', 129.50, 35, 4.6),
    (10, 'Premium Coffee Maker', 'Kitchen Supplies', 79.99, 50, 4.9),
    (11, 'Ergonomic Office Chair', 'Furnishings', 189.00, 20, 4.5),
    (12, 'Wireless Earbuds', 'Electronics', 49.99, 75, 4.3),
    (13, 'Slow Cooker', 'Appliances', 49.95, 30, 4.7),
    (14, 'Cutlery Set', 'Kitchen Supplies', 34.50, 40, 4.4),
    (15, 'Cozy Throw Blanket', 'Furnishings', 24.99, 100, 4.2);

# 1. Write your own SQL query that uses a SELECT statement to order the items by price.

SELECT item_name, price FROM superstore
ORDER BY price;

SELECT * FROM superstore
WHERE price > 100.00
ORDER BY price DESC;

# 2. Write your own SQL query that will show a statistic about the item prices, like a sum, average, minimum, maximum, or count.

SELECT item_name, MAX(price) AS price FROM superstore
WHERE category = 'Electronics';


# 3. Write your own SQL query that will show a statistic about the price for items in the category of "Kitchen Supplies". 
SELECT item_name, MIN(stock_quantity) FROM superstore
WHERE category = 'Kitchen Supplies';


# 4. Come up with your own question about the data and try to answer it using SQL. For example: How many air purifiers are in stock? 
# It's okay if you can't figure out how to answer your question, the idea here is to practice thinking about what kinds of insights you can get from a dataset from asking questions about it.


SELECT item_name, price, average_rating FROM superstore
WHERE average_rating >= 4.5
ORDER BY price DESC;

SELECT COUNT(*) AS Total_Items, category FROM superstore
GROUP BY category;
